# Departments Components Fix - TODO

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Fixed BaseListComponent Integration Issues
- [x] **ProgramListComponent**: Removed override of `loadDataFromServer()` method
- [x] **FacultyListComponent**: Removed override of `loadDataFromServer()` method
- [x] **ActivityListComponent**: Removed override of `loadDataFromServer()` method

### What This Fixes:
- Components now use the base class's data loading mechanism
- Proper pagination, filtering, and sorting functionality restored
- Consistent data loading behavior across all list components
- Integration with `DataTableService.loadData()` for standardized table operations

## Next Steps ðŸ”„

### Testing Required:
- [ ] **Test ProgramListComponent**: Verify pagination, filtering, and sorting work correctly
- [ ] **Test FacultyListComponent**: Verify pagination, filtering, and sorting work correctly
- [ ] **Test ActivityListComponent**: Verify pagination, filtering, and sorting work correctly
- [ ] **Test DepartmentsComponent**: Ensure main departments listing still works properly

### Verification Steps:
1. Navigate to each component in the application
2. Test table functionality:
   - Pagination (page size, navigation)
   - Column sorting (click column headers)
   - Column filtering (use filter inputs)
   - Delete operations
   - Add/Edit operations
3. Verify data loads correctly from the API endpoints
4. Check error handling for failed requests

### Additional Considerations:
- [ ] Verify API endpoints match the URLs configured in `tableOptions`
- [ ] Test with different data sizes to ensure pagination works
- [ ] Verify responsive design still works on mobile devices
- [ ] Check that Arabic text displays correctly

## Files Modified:
- `src/app/pages/settings/Departments/Components/program-list/program-list.component.ts`
- `src/app/pages/settings/Departments/Components/faculty-list/faculty-list.component.ts`
- `src/app/pages/settings/Departments/Components/activity-list/activity-list.component.ts`

## Benefits of This Fix:
- âœ… Consistent table behavior across all department sub-components
- âœ… Proper pagination, filtering, and sorting functionality
- âœ… Better maintainability (single data loading implementation)
- âœ… Integration with base class features (export, bulk operations, etc.)
- âœ… Reduced code duplication
